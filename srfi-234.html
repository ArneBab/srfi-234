<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Topological sorting is an algorithm that takes a graph consisting of
nodes and other nodes that depend on them, forming a partial order,
and returns a list representing a total ordering of the graph.
If the graph is cyclic, the topological sort will fail, and an
error will be signaled.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>Consider the following graph representing steps to be performed:</p>

<img src="Directed_acyclic_graph_2.svg">

<p>This graph means that (among other things) steps 5 and 7 must be
performed before step 11, and step 11 must be performed before steps 2, 9,
and 10.  By topologically sorting this graph, we get one possible total
ordering of the steps that satisfies the partial order.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p><code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph =</em><code>)</code></p>
<p><em>Topologically sorts <em>graph</em>,
which is a list of sublists.  Each sublist is of the form
<code>(</code><em>node dependency dependency</em> ...<code>)</code>,
meaning that <em>dependencies</em> are dependent on <em>node</em>.
The optional argument <em>=</em> specifies the identity relation
between nodes; it defaults to <code>eqv?</code>.</p>
<p>It is an error if the same node (in the sense of <em>=</em>) appears
in more than one sublist.<p>
<p>If <em>graph</em> is circular, an error satisfying
<code>circular-graph?</code> is signaled.</p>
<p>The graph shown above can be represented as
<code>((5 11) (7 11 8) (3 8 10) (11 2 9 10) (8 9))</code>.
